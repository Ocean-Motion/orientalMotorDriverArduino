This code will operate the Oritnal Motor with ~480:1 gearbox in an ocsilating manner for angles 1-90 degress and speeds in RPM. 
It was orginally done by INtern John Funk in Summer 2024. 
THe target controller is an Arduino.  

Additionally this code will run the torque sensor either independently or in conjunction with the Oriental motor.
